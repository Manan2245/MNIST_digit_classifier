# MNIST Digit Classification

This repository contains a simple Python project for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using machine learning techniques. The MNIST dataset is a popular dataset in the field of computer vision and serves as a great starting point for learning and experimenting with image classification.

## About MNIST Dataset

The MNIST dataset consists of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 through 9) and their corresponding labels. The goal of this project is to build a model that can accurately classify these digits.
